## Feature Description
<!-- A clear and concise description of the econometric algorithm or enhancement you'd like -->

## Algorithm Type
<!-- What type of econometric method is this? -->
- [ ] Causal Inference (DID, RDD, IV, etc.)
- [ ] Panel Data Methods (Fixed Effects, Random Effects)
- [ ] Time Series (ARIMA, VAR, Cointegration)
- [ ] Machine Learning for Econometrics (DML, Double ML)
- [ ] Microeconometrics (Logit, Probit, Count Models)
- [ ] Macroeconometrics (DSGE, SVAR)
- [ ] Survey Methods (Weighting, Imputation)
- [ ] Other (please specify): 

## Problem It Solves
<!-- What specific econometric problem does this solve? What are the use cases? -->

## Proposed Implementation
<!-- If you have ideas about implementation: -->
- **Method Name**: [e.g., `TwoWayFixedEffects`, `SyntheticControl`]
- **API Design**: [how should users call it?]
- **Key Parameters**: [what arguments are needed?]
- **Return Values**: [what should the method return?]

## Reference Implementation
<!-- Link to any papers, R packages, Stata commands, or other implementations -->
- Paper: [title and link]
