    """
    Concrete DML estimator using kernel‐based second‐stage regression.

    Performs cross‐fitting for nuisance models to get residuals, then uses
    a kernel ridge regression (or other kernel method) to regress residual_y on
    residual_t and possibly X for heterogeneity. Produces ATE and CATE estimates.

    Attributes:
        kernel (str): Name of kernel function (e.g., 'rbf', 'polynomial').
        bandwidth (float): Bandwidth parameter for kernel computations.
        regularization (float): Regularization strength for kernel ridge regression.
        theta_hat (float): Estimated ATE after fitting.
        se_hat (float): Standard error estimate for ATE (optional).
