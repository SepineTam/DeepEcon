    Concrete DML estimator using causal (orthogonal) random forests for second‐stage.

    Inherits from DML base. Uses cross‐fitting to compute residuals,
    then fits a forest that splits on X to predict residual_y from residual_t
    locally (i.e., learns heterogeneous CATEs via tree ensemble).

    Attributes:
        forest_model (object): Underlying forest implementation for CATE estimation.
        theta_hat (float): Estimated ATE (e.g., average of forest‐predicted CATEs).
        se_hat (float): Estimated standard error for ATE (optional).
